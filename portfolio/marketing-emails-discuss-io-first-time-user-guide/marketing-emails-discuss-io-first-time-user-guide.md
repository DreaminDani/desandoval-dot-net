Upon visiting [Discuss.IO](https://discuss.io) for the first time, users were greeted with a friendly message from our sales representative â€“ asking them to set up a meeting to go over the various features. After [generating video tutorials](/portfolio/web-design-content-discuss-io-video-tutorials/) to replace this overhead, I created a series of emails to send out to users who have just signed up.

The goal of these emails is to introduce new users to the product as well as provide a reminder that they have signed up for the service.

The entire series can be found by signing up for Discuss.io!

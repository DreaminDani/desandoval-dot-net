In the summer of 2015, [Miguel Willis](http://www.nationaljurist.com/national-jurist-magazine/law-student-year-miguel-willis-seattle-university) approached me to ask if I would be interested in helping him host the Social Justice Hackathon - an event that he was fundraising for to "unite the legal and tech communities to create innovative solutions to American access to justice."

Together we worked nights and weekends to bring over 80 developers, designers, lawyers, law students, and business developers together to create innovative solutions to some of the most challenging problems facing our legal aid system.

I spent most of my time working as the designer - creating the website, social media assets, t-shirts, stickers, banners, etc. that would be used before, during and after the event.

## The Prompt
> Seattle Social Justice Hackathon (SSJH) - At least 80 percent of the legal needs of the poor and two-thirds of the legal needs of middle income Americans are not met. Seattle University's Social Justice Hackathon... seek[s] to eliminate the gap between those who need civil legal services and those who provide legal resources.

From this, I created the first asset - a logo that represented the event:

This logo ended up on the website, whose content, font style and color scheme was adjusted to match:

As the event came closer, I produced a flyer, sticker and t-shirts...

For the day of the event, I created banners (full-size to go next to the podium), posters and various printouts (including a customizable letterhead) to go around Seattle University's School of Law - the event venue:

## The Demo Day

Following a long weekend full of coffee, computers and internet connectivity issues, the hackathon came to a close. After getting some sleep, Miguel and I started work on the Demo Day - planned for February 2016 at City Hall.

Along with designing the assests for the event, I also advised the three winning teams of SSJH as a UX professional.
